## The _itty bitty_ Committee

### An open source project to improve accessibility for all internet users

## Why

Platforms are responsible for providing
[equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility),
but unfortunately there are popular websites that prioritize _itty bitty_ design
practices instead.

The internet is a considered
[a basic human right](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html)
and options for accessibility features should always be available. Accessibility
is essential for disabled users and
[beneficial for all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f31oufqFSM).

**Exclusion _is_ and _always will be_ unacceptable!**

## What

The _itty bitty_ Committee is providing resources to modify styles that increase
the accessibility of websites through contributions by the community.

Improvements can be installed individually
([like wider scrollbars](https://github.com/itty-bitty-committee/scrollbar)) or
bundled with
[all accessibility styles](https://github.com/itty-bitty-committee/itty-bitty)
that have been contributed so far. Modifications are also customizable when
possible.

## Submit

If there is a website with accessibility features that you would like to see
improved, please [submit a request](https://github.com/itty-bitty-committee) or
if you can, [contribute a solution](#contributing)! Otherwise a member of The
_itty bitty_ Committee will review your submission and work with the community
to include your improvement.

## Contribute

Component improvements are separated into individual repos and are compiled into
the [itty-bitty](https://github.com/itty-bitty-committee/itty-bitty) bundle when
merged. Documentation for contributing is available per repo.

If a repo does not exist for the component you would like to contribute an
accessibility improvement for, please
[submit a request](https://github.com/itty-bitty-committee) detailing the
component, why and how it should be modified, and an example platform that would
benefit from the modification.
